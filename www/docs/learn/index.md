We created this tutorial to help you build your first app with SST!

We'll cover most of the key concepts of SST. You'll get a feel for how SST works and we'll end by deploying our app to production!

### What are we building

The starter we'll be using creates a very simple Reddit clone called _"Links"_. You can submit links to it and it'll display all the links that have been submitted.

This tutorial should take less than an hour. We recommend going through it once.

We'll then walk through the process of adding a new feature. We'll allow our users to add comments for these links!

Let's look at what we'll be covering. You could also just get started right away by jumping ahead to the next chapter â€” [**Create a new SST project**](create-a-new-project.md).

### What are we covering

We've structured this tutorial in a way that shows you what the development workflow looks like while working with SST. We start with setting up your local development environment and go all the way to "git push to deploy" in production.

Here's roughly what we'll be covering in the next few chapters:

1. Creating a new SST app
2. Setting up your local dev environment
3. Writing to a database
4. Connecting it to your API 
5. Rendering it in the frontend
6. Deploying to production

### What's in the starter

Our _Links_ app is based on a starter that we recommend for building full-stack serverless applications. At a very high level, we are using the following:

- SST's constructs to define our infrastructure
- PostgreSQL (or DynamoDB) for our database
- GraphQL for the API
- React for our frontend

We also use a couple of other notable open-source libraries in our setup.

- [Kysely](https://koskimas.github.io/kysely), a type-safe TypeScript SQL query builder
- [ElectroDB](https://github.com/tywalch/electrodb), a type-safe TypeScript library for DynamoDB
- [Pothos](https://pothos-graphql.dev), a type-safe TypeScript GraphQL schema builder

You might've guessed that we really care about type-safety!

End-to-end type-safety, is one of the defining features of SST. Everything including our frontend, backend, GraphQL schema definitions, environment variables, and infrastructure is type-safe. It helps us prevent any mistakes, and it also allows our editors to auto-complete our code!
